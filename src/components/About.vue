      <p class="blue-text">I am an independent individual who values autonomy and self-reliance. 
         I make decisions <br> based on my own judgment and don't rely heavily on others for validation or direction.  <br>
         I take pride in my ability to manage tasks and solve problems on my own. 
         Being independent  <br>allows me to pursue my interests and goals with determination and confidence. 
         I am self-motivated, resourceful, and enjoy the freedom that comes with being independent.</p>
